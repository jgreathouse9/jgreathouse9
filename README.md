## Hi ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š


Hi, I'm Jared Amani Greathouse. I am a public policy PHD candidate at Georgia State and the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jason Coupet](https://aysps.gsu.edu/profile/jason-coupet/). Prior, I earned my Bachelors and Masters in political science from Georgia State University. I am an econometrician specializing in causal inference, *particularly* with the synthetic control method and difference-in-differences.

If causal inference is your thing, check out [the software I develop](https://mlsynth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) Python or Stata. I am [also](https://www.statalist.org/forums/member/51320-jared-greathouse) an active contributor to the Statalist forum. [Here's my vita](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/files/VitaWeb.pdf). If you'd like to talk with me about my work, my consulting services, or anything else that's of interest, you may always reach out to me!
